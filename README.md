🔐 How to use Command Line Interface: 

 *  Navigate to file directory containing app
 *  Type "npm i" to install required dependencies
 *  Type "node myapp init --all" to initialize and install application
 *  Type "node myapp" for a detailed list of commands that can be used.

🧑🏽‍💻 How to use web-server:

 *  In a new terminal, navigate to file directory containing app.
 *  Input "node server" to run web server.
 *  Navigate in a web browser to "localhost:3500"
 *  The webform will allow the user to generate, display and search tokens and user records.


💾Logging:
     Files are logged on a daily basis and use the following format:
     ______________________


🧪 Testing:
    Expiry is handled by both the CLI and web form. Just edit the expiry date of a user object in the token.json array to a date in the past. If a token already exists for a username, but is expired at the time it is referenced, it will be deleted before it can be returned. If a new token is being requested, it will do so without error.

👨‍🏫 TODO:
    - Add a function to clear database of expired tokens before they are called ⏰
    - Implement additional administrator functions in both web form and CLI 🤓
    - Serve custom URLs to our routes using the response parameters. ｛🤯｝
    - Figure out how to style the returned JSON text for the local webserver. 🤔
